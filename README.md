# COMP472-A1

***Task 0***
- Open your command line and navigate to the directory which has the file containing all python code & associated files.
- Run the python code by entering "python task0.py" or "python3 task0.py".
- In the dataset folder you will notice 3 new files with the following titles: "training_dataset", "evaluation_dataset", "all_sentiment_shuffled_filtered".

***Task 1***
- Requires Task0 to be completed since we will be using some of the files generated from Task0.
- Run "pip install matplotlib" in your console to install the library which plots the bar chart.
- Open your command line and navigate to the directory which has the file containing all python code & associated files.
- Run the python code "python task1.py" or "python3 task1.py".
- A graph should be generated and in the console you should see the exact values of each class (neg & pos).

***Task 2***
- Requires Task0 & Task1 to be completed.
- Run "pip install -U scikit-learn" in your console to install the scikit library.
- Open your command line and navigate to the directory which has the file containing all python code & associated files.
- First run the python code "python task2_utils.py" or "python3 task2_utils.py" to generate the associated files for Task2.
- Then run the python code "python task2.py" or "python3 task2.py".
- Depending on which ML model you'd like to test, you will need to uncomment the method in main().
- *Optional*: You may also uncomment the print() lines in the associated method to see an output.

***Task 3***
- Requires Task0, Task1, Task2 to be completed.
- Open your command line and navigate to the directory which has the file containing all python code & associated files.
- Run the python code "python task3.py" or "python3 task3.py" to generate the associated files for Task3.
- Three(3) files ('naive_bayes.txt', 'base_dt.txt', 'best_dt.txt') should be generated in '..\dataset\task3_reports' folder

***Task 4***
- Open the word document 'COMP472_A1_task4' found in the '..\dataset\task3_reports' folder.
